🚀 About Me
</h2>
I am a junior software developer focused on building real-world, practical applications.  
I work in a project-based manner and have hands-on experience in full-stack web development using Python (Flask),  
as well as end-to-end desktop application development with C#.

I value clean structure, clear logic, and maintainable code.
